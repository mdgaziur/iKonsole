# iKonsole

I've coded iKonsole from scratch to make sure I can update it more fluently. You can see the old repository on https://github.com/mdgaziur/ikonsole-old.

All the improvements will be done on this repository.

So, finally making some developments, I uploaded the files to this repository. It's still in development. It will be updated daily.

Until the final release of this version(0.4), you can give me suggestions or report bugs to my following email address:
